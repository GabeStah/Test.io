<h1 id="how-crowdtesting-fits-with-software-testing-methodologies">How Crowdtesting Fits With Software Testing Methodologies</h1>
<p>Crowdsourced testing, or <code>crowdtesting</code> for short, is a testing methodology that takes advantage of the efficiency and benefits of crowdsourcing. As <code>waterfall</code>, <code>agile</code>, and hybrid development methodologies become more prevalent in the development world, it's critical to understand both the strengths and weaknesses of these common software testing methodologies, and how the inclusion of <code>crowdtesting</code> can plug any holes that may spring up during the software development life cycle.</p>
<p>In this article, we'll take a closer look at how <code>crowdtesting</code> software testing methodologies can better support the traditional <code>agile</code>, <code>waterfall</code>, and <code>hybrid</code> development models, so let's get started!</p>
<h2 id="crowdtesting-and-agile-development">Crowdtesting and Agile Development</h2>
<p>One of the key tenets of the <code>agile software development</code> methodology is the concept of <code>iteration</code> and <code>incremental evolution</code> of the project throughout the entire software development life cycle. As fresh ideas come to fruition and new systems are developed to bring those ideas to life, often the project will go through varying versions or <code>prototypes</code>, allowing the entire development team, testers, and even clients to experience the project via a hands-on approach.</p>
<p>Not only does this common <code>iterative</code> prototyping practice ensure that projects are of the highest possible quality throughout each stage of the software development life cycle, but it also allows the team to quickly recognize necessary changes and allows the project the flexibility to quickly adapt to these ever-changing needs.</p>
<p>An often overlooked benefit to this frequency of prototyping is the extremely powerful ability to allow a plethora of testers, via <code>crowdtesting</code>, to poke and prod at this particular prototype release, examining it in detail for bugs or minor imperfections that in-house developers simply wouldn't notice or even think to look for. At the most fundamental level, utilizing <code>crowdtesting</code> for each prototype release during an <code>agile development</code> life cycle means that each minor version release is given its very own real-world beta testing period. By using the power of crowdsourced testing at every major step along the way, the project is certain to be that much more robust and durable when compared to using only in-house testing methodologies.</p>
<p><code>Crowdtesting</code> also largely reduces the expense of running tests, by reducing overhead and risk, allowing for tests to be performed at any time and for virtually any reason.</p>
<h2 id="crowdtesting-and-waterfall-development">Crowdtesting and Waterfall Development</h2>
<p><code>Waterfall</code> development models have been in use for decades now, and while <code>agile</code> methodologies (or <code>hybrids</code> of the two) are on the rise, <code>waterfall</code> remains a staple in the community. Unfortunately, the typical <code>waterfall</code> development model can promote a number of problematic practices when it finally comes time for testing. Since <code>waterfall</code> models are often stringent, forcing various task and phases to be complete before the next can occur, this frequently leads to the postponement of the testing phase until the very last minute. Invariably, it's all-too-common for the testing phase during <code>waterfall</code> development to be rushed, not providing QA and other testers enough time or resources to fully flesh out all testing procedures.</p>
<p>The introduction of <code>crowdtesting</code> into the <code>waterfall</code> development model can be a great boon to alleviate some of that testing headache that often appears late into the development life cycle. By reducing the barrier of entry necessary to implement and perform tests, and by promoting more comprehensive test coverage capabilities than most in-house QA departments, <code>crowdtesting</code> can provide a real breakthrough, with tangible and immediate benefits within <code>waterfall</code> testing procedures.</p>
<h2 id="crowdtesting-and-hybrid-development-models">Crowdtesting and Hybrid Development Models</h2>
<p>Try as we might to implement the most streamlined and perfect development model to every project we begin, the reality is that many projects invariably fall into the category of neither purely <code>agile</code> nor purely <code>waterfall</code>, but somewhere in between. It is common in these <code>hybrid</code> models, in spite of the best intentions by the project team, for testing to frequently fall by the wayside.</p>
<p>The influence of the <code>waterfall</code> components on the project can invariably lead to delayed testing phases, dramatically reducing the likelihood of identifying and squashing a large portion -- let alone the majority -- of bugs that may exist. Similarly, imperfectly <code>agile</code> implementation may fail to produce thorough developer-driven unit tests and front-end functional tests, both of which are necessary to generate a fully-functional product.</p>
<p>Just as it can help with pure implementations of <code>agile</code> or <code>waterfall</code> models, <code>crowdtesting</code> can also greatly benefit the software testing procedures of <code>hybrid</code> development models as well. Most importantly, <code>crowdtesting</code> provides a bit of a safety blanket that can help reduce any troubles with testing procedures in a <code>hybrid</code> model by providing flexible, low-cost testing at every step along the way, producing a more robust and durable project when compared to solely using in-house testing methodologies.</p>
<h2 id="crowdtesting-a-key-piece-in-the-puzzle">Crowdtesting: A Key Piece in the Puzzle</h2>
<p>While <code>crowdtesting</code> is an extremely powerful method of testing throughout the entire software development life cycle, it's critical to understand that <code>crowdtesting</code> is just one more powerful tool in the larger testing toolkit, and recognizing when and where to implement it is key. While <code>unit testing</code> and other developer-driven testing procedures almost always take place, no matter the size of the project, it's important to realize that <code>crowdtesting</code> is another piece of that testing puzzle, alongside unit testing, which should be implemented when and where it provides the most benefit.</p>
<p>While automated testing is a crucial component to the development process, <code>crowdtesting</code> promotes the integration of <em>human testing</em> into the overall testing process. Unlike automated testing, <code>crowdtesting</code> allows for tests to be performed in the real world, by a wide range of people on a variety of devices and platforms, in environments and locales where people truly live. Even the best automated testing processes or services cannot emulate the power and sheer diversity that <code>crowdtesting</code> provides.</p>
<p>In short, <code>crowdtesting</code> provides feedback and results that are personalized, mirroring the experiences that actual users are likely to have with that product. The world doesn't care if your testing methods are perfect, it only cares that your software works, and <code>crowdtesting</code> can often help with that.</p>

<h2 id="when-testing-and-humanity-collide">When Testing and Humanity Collide</h2>
<p>At the most fundamental level, crowdsourced testing, or <code>crowdtesting</code> for short, is a testing methodology that takes advantage of the efficiency and benefits of crowdsourcing for use during typical software testing processes. By utilizing a large pool of testers, the development team can better rely on a group of testers which a wide range of attributes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Numerous Locales &amp; Languages</li>
<li>Various Levels of Expertise</li>
<li>Differing Devices &amp; Hardware Configurations</li>
<li>Assorted Demographics</li>
</ul>
<p>Given this plethora of varied and unique attributes across the entire base of testers assigned to the project, the QA team can be confident that nearly every angle of attack is being thoroughly tested and retested across the massive spectrum of testers assigned to the project.</p>
<h2 id="crowdtesting-during-refactoring">Crowdtesting During Refactoring</h2>
<p>In software development, the basic concept of <code>factoring</code> code is a method by which complex systems are broken down into smaller and simpler sub-systems, which are now invariably easier to develop and maintain. By extension, the process of <code>refactoring</code> is simply breaking down <em>existing</em> code into smaller chunks, which critically do not alter the final behavior of the code in question.</p>
<p>The process of <code>refactoring</code> is so common and critical within nearly every software development life cycle that any improvement that can be made to the process, whether small or large, is a huge boon to the development team, as well as to the project as a whole. When any system within a project can be dissected and broken down into smaller parts that are easier to understand by everyone involved, the project is always improved and made better.</p>
<p>It should, therefore, come as no surprise that implementation of a <code>crowdtesting methodology</code> into the refactoring process is one simple, yet powerful, step that can greatly improve the quality of the <code>refactoring</code> that is about to take place.</p>
<p>For example, if the codebase for a web project is due for a <code>refactoring</code> pass on the systems that handle user sessions (signing in/out, security, navigating, etc.), it can be incredibly beneficial to perform a <code>crowdtesting</code> pass on those systems <em>before</em> any <code>refactoring</code> takes place. More often than not, testers may find bugs or even point to improvements that would dramatically alter the end-result of the system and how it functions, saving a great deal of unnecessary or even wasted coding time during the subsequent <code>refactoring</code> procedures.</p>

At the most fundamental level, utilizing <code>crowdtesting</code> for each prototype release during an <code>agile development</code> life cycle means that each minor version release is given its very own real-world beta testing period.
