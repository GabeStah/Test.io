<h1 id="qa-services-vs-qa-as-a-service-is-there-a-difference">QA Services vs QA as a Service: Is There a Difference?</h1>
<p>Quality assurance services (<code>QA Services</code>) and quality assurance as a service (<code>QA as a Service</code>) are similar terms and, to most people, even similar concepts, yet there are a few important differences between the two. Centered around the core concepts of <code>outsourcing</code> vs <code>crowdsourcing</code> -- which underpin both terms, respectively -- fully grasping the subtle distinctions between the two is critical when planning the testing procedures for your own projects.</p>
<p>In this article, we'll examine both the similarities and the fundamental differences between <code>QA Services</code> and <code>QA as a Service</code>. We'll delve into why it's easy to fall into the trap of assuming <code>QA Services</code> are the best (and only) solution available, and how <code>QA as a Service</code> can provide unique benefits at a fraction of the cost.</p>
<h2 id="outsourcing-vs-crowdsourcing">Outsourcing vs Crowdsourcing</h2>
<p>To readily understand the difference between <code>QA Services</code> and <code>QA as a Service</code>, it's necessary for us to explore the relationship, and fundamental differences, between <code>outsourcing</code> and <code>crowdsourcing</code>.</p>
<p><code>Outsourcing</code> is a well-known and general term used to describe contracting out a process of some kind to a third-party. <code>Outsourcing</code> largely <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep590/04au/clearedprojects/Dorwin.pdf"><code>came about during the rise</code></a> of modern business practices in the late 19th century. As technology improved and railroads became the norm for transportation of goods, businesses soon found it financially beneficial to <code>outsource</code> manufacturing or other services of scale for their own business needs, rather than doing everything &quot;in-house.&quot;</p>
<p>The term <code>crowdsourcing</code> is a far more modern by comparison, first coined by <a href="https://www.wired.com/"><code>WIRED</code></a> contributing editor Mark Howe in his 2006 article, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2006/06/crowds/"><em>The Rise of Crowdsourcing</em></a>. Loosely defined, <code>crowdsourcing</code> is the act of taking a task, typically performed by a specific agent (such as an employee or agency), and instead assigning it to a undefined, larger group of people.</p>
<p>While <code>crowdsourcing</code> has been used historically for centuries, most modern references to the term refer to the use of the Internet and other modern communication tools, as a means of gathering input and feedback from a wide range of individuals in near real-time.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-quality-assurance-services">What are Quality Assurance Services?</h2>
<p>For the most part, a <code>QA Service</code> is able to provide testing services that are very specific in nature, utilizing a particular in-house team with a specific level of expertise in various areas of quality assurance. This could be anything from designing and developing a series of automated load tests to implementing specific technologies necessary for your project's required technology stack.</p>
<p>Therefore, a <code>QA Service</code> is ideal for targeted, smaller quality assurance and testing practices that are simply too time-consuming to be handled by the in-house QA team. Developing automated tests, performing script maintenance, and analyzing service response times are all likely candidates for the services of a particular <code>QA Service</code>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-quality-assurance-as-a-service">What is Quality Assurance as a Service?</h2>
<p>Unlike <code>QA Services</code>, <code>QA as a Service</code> is far more flexible and provides a very broad set of testing capabilities. Due to the huge number of individuals that are involved in the <code>crowdsourced</code> nature of <code>QA as a Service</code> platforms, particular aspects of a project can be tested and retested by thousands of individuals in real-world settings, from various locales, and using real-world devices.</p>
<p><code>QA as a Service</code> can be implemented at whim, to perform testing during an entire software development life cycle, just to test a specific prototype build, or even to test a particular feature of a much larger project. This, in turn, allows testing to be performed at as broad or as detailed a level as necessary, with costs scaling appropriately to those specific needs.</p>
<p>Perhaps best of all for QA teams and managers, the <code>crowdsourced</code> component of <code>QA as a Service</code> means that testing processes are flexible enough to be scaled as necessary, from week to week or from one component to another, as the demands of the project shift.</p>
<h2 id="where-crowdsourcing-conquers-outsourcing">Where Crowdsourcing Conquers Outsourcing</h2>
<p>Since <code>QA Services</code> can best be thought of as a form of <code>outsourcing</code> the quality assurance procedures for a project, whereas <code>QA as a Service</code> more closely resembles <code>crowdsourcing</code>, we can begin to examine the differences between the two practices and where one may outshine the other.</p>
<p>The reason <code>QA Services</code> are largely a form of <code>outsourcing</code>, in the realm of software quality assurance, is simply because they typically come as a predefined package. Any given <code>QA Service</code> is likely a team from a single locale, which speaks the same or very few differing languages, maintains a rather rigid workforce, works a specific range of hours a day, and usually charges based on man-hours worked in addition to flat fees.</p>
<p>Moreover, <code>outsourcing</code> quality assurance services largely requires a great deal of managerial overhead, such as establishing a third-party project manager, creating detailed scope documentation and contracts, and properly educating the outsourced team on best practices and procedures.</p>
<p>Conversely, <code>QA as a Service</code> is comparable to flexible, on-demand cloud-based services like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"><code>Amazon Web Services</code></a> and <a href="https://www.heroku.com/"><code>Heroku</code></a>. Rather than hiring and managing a specific, predefined team or company to perform quality assurance services for you, you're effectively hiring a wide range of people from all backgrounds, across all devices, from all locales, at whatever level of detail and scalability your project requires.</p>
<p>This <code>crowdsourced</code> nature of <code>QA as a Service</code> means that the testing procedures of the project are far less rigid than when utilizing a <code>QA Service</code>. Since each individual within the much large crowd comes at the testing from a slightly different angle and perspective, this can often result in finding (and eventually squashing) a wide range of bugs and quirks that simply wouldn't have been noticed in a more stringent <code>QA Service</code> environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, while <code>QA Services</code> typically charge flat fees and rates, along with dynamic charges for man-hours invested across the team, many <code>crowdsourcing</code> platforms only charge fees for actionable results, such as newly discovered bugs. This means not only do the testers in the <code>crowdsourced</code> method have personal incentive to perform efficiently and effectively, but it also means you don't pay for extraneous services or fees which may not produce useful results.</p>
