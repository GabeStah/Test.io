# QA Services vs QA as a Service: Is There a Difference?

Within any project, proper quality assurance (`QA`) is a fundamental and highly necessary component, necessary to produce the most functional and intended resulting product.  With software in particular, the role of quality assurance takes on slightly more specific requirements, in order to ensure the final result is of the highest quality.

While software quality assurance practices can range from determining the best software development methodology to project management techniques, the most fundamental component of software QA is that of developing and implementing proper testing procedures.  Ensuring a high standard of testing invariably assures a high quality of the final product.

Modern software development life cycles demand a plethora of various procedures and methodologies, depending on the specific needs of the project, but, by and large, the inclusion of proper quality assurance procedures cannot be neglected.  The challenge then becomes: What software quality assurance process is the best?  What will best meet the needs of your team and your project, while avoiding as many unnecessary costs as possible?

In this article, we'll examine both the similarities and the dramatic, fundamental differences between quality assurance services (`QA Services`) and quality assurance as a service (`QA as a Service`).  We'll delve into why it's easy to fall into the trap of assuming `QA Services` are the best (and only) solution available, and how `QA as a Service` can provide unique benefits at a fraction of the cost.

## Outsourcing vs Crowdsourcing

To readily understand the difference between `QA Services` and `QA as a Service`, it's necessary for us to explore the relationship, and fundamental differences, between `outsourcing` and `crowdsourcing`.

`Outsourcing` is a well-known and general term used to describe contracting out a process of some kind to a third-party.  `Outsourcing` largely [`came about during the rise`] of modern business practices in the late 19th century.  As technology improved and railroads became the norm for transportation of goods, businesses soon found it financially beneficial to `outsource` manufacturing or other services of scale for their own business needs, rather than doing everything "in-house."

The term `crowdsourcing` is a far more modern by comparison, first coined by [`WIRED`] contributing editor Mark Howe in his 2006 article, [_The Rise of Crowdsourcing_].  Loosely defined, `crowdsourcing` is the act of taking a task, typically performed by a specific agent (such as an employee or agency), and instead assigning it to a undefined, larger group of people.

While `crowdsourcing` has been used historically for centuries, most modern references to the term refer to the use of the Internet and other modern communication tools, as a means of gathering input and feedback from a wide range of individuals in near real-time.

## What are Quality Assurance Services?

For the most part, a `QA Service` is able to provide testing services that are very specific in nature, utilizing a particular in-house team with a specific level of expertise in various areas of quality assurance.  This could be anything from designing and developing a series of automated load tests to implementing specific technologies necessary for your project's required technology stack.

Therefore, a `QA Service` is ideal for targeted, smaller quality assurance and testing practices that are simply too time-consuming to be handled by the in-house QA team.  Developing automated tests, performing script maintenance, and analyzing service response times are all likely candidates for the services of a particular `QA Service`.

## What is Quality Assurance as a Service?

Unlike `QA Services`, `QA as a Service` is far more flexible and provides a very broad set of testing capabilities.  Due to the huge number of individuals that are involved in the `crowdsourced` nature of `QA as a Service` platforms, particular aspects of a project can be tested and retested by thousands of individuals in real-world settings, from various locales, and using real-world devices.

`QA as a Service` can be implemented at whim, to perform testing during an entire software development life cycle, just to test a specific prototype build, or even to test a particular feature of a much larger project.  This, in turn, allows testing to be performed at as broad or as detailed a level as necessary, with costs scaling appropriately to those specific needs.

Perhaps best of all for QA teams and managers, the `crowdsourced` component of `QA as a Service` means that testing processes are flexible enough to be scaled as necessary, from week to week or from one component to another, as the demands of the project shift.

## Where Crowdsourcing Conquers Outsourcing

Since `QA Services` can best be thought of as a form of `outsourcing` the quality assurance procedures for a project, whereas `QA as a Service` more closely resembles `crowdsourcing`, we can begin to examine the differences between the two practices and where one may outshine the other.

The reason `QA Services` are largely a form of `outsourcing`, in the realm of software quality assurance, is simply because they typically come as a predefined package.  Any given `QA Service` is likely a team from a single locale, which speaks the same or very few differing languages, maintains a rather rigid workforce, works a specific range of hours a day, and usually charges based on man-hours worked in addition to flat fees.

Moreover, `outsourcing` quality assurance services largely requires a great deal of managerial overhead, such as establishing a third-party project manager, creating detailed scope documentation and contracts, and properly educating the outsourced team on best practices and procedures.

Conversely, `QA as a Service` is comparable to flexible, on-demand cloud-based services like [`Amazon Web Services`] and [`Heroku`].  Rather than hiring and managing a specific, predefined team or company to perform quality assurance services for you, you're effectively hiring a wide range of people from all backgrounds, across all devices, from all locales, at whatever level of detail and scalability your project requires.

This `crowdsourced` nature of `QA as a Service` means that the testing procedures of the project are far less rigid than when utilizing a `QA Service`.  Since each individual within the much large crowd comes at the testing from a slightly different angle and perspective, this can often result in finding (and eventually squashing) a wide range of bugs and quirks that simply wouldn't have been noticed in a more stringent `QA Service` environment.

Additionally, while `QA Services` typically charge flat fees and rates, along with dynamic charges for man-hours invested across the team, many `crowdsourcing` platforms only charge fees for actionable results, such as newly discovered bugs.  This means not only do the testers in the `crowdsourced` method have personal incentive to perform efficiently and effectively, but it also means you don't pay for extraneous services or fees which may not produce useful results.
