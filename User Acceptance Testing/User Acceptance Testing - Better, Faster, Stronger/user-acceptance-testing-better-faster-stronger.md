# User Acceptance Testing: Better, Faster, Stronger

User acceptance testing (`UAT`) is an absolutely necessary process for nearly every piece of software.  Neglecting the usability aspects of a project can lead to poor user experience, unwieldy interfaces, or even build-breaking bugs in some cases.  Even if a worst case scenario doesn't come to fruition, software that passes all traditional test cases, but hasn't been properly tested for user acceptance, is far more likely to cause damage down the line.  These could entail damages your organization's reputation, monetary damages, or even legal damages.

Thankfully, you can improve your UAT capabilities and reduce your potential for risk by performing UAT via `crowdtesting`.  `Crowdtesting` can be activated at will, beginning with the first stages of the software development life cycle, so there's no potential risk of waiting to perform UAT until the last minute.  `Crowdtesting` also provides a simple way to gather unique, insightful usability feedback from unique, insightful individuals, working and living across many locales around the world, ensuring your software's usability needs are tested from as many angles as possible.

In this article, we'll take a deep dive into `crowdtesting`, exploring how it can provide dramatic benefits when compared to traditional user acceptance testing methodologies.

## Immediate and Continuous UAT

Traditionally, a major challenge of user acceptance testing is the need for **actual users** to interact with your software.  By providing users with access, they see all the bad (along with the good) that your product has to offer.  Often, this forces the development team to postpone UAT until fairly late into the software development life cycle, since it would be tragic to open things up to UAT through a beta test or otherwise, only to have the software crash and burn in the process.

Terrible public relations aside, the pain of waiting to begin UAT -- which is often self-inflicted by developers, managers, or even marketers -- means that the software itself suffers for the lengthy period leading up to when UAT can officially begin.  During this time, user acceptance testing is often largely ignored, which can cause major problems later in the development life cycle as unforeseen issues emerge.  Typically these problems might include issues with the UI, localization, connectivity, system integrations, and many other end-to-end functionalities that weren't fully tested up to this point.

Even in the best-case scenarios where your team is large enough to employ an in-house QA department that is able to perform UAT right from the get-go, rarely can an organization maintain a roster of testers large enough or diverse enough to handle every problem or foresee every potential issue.

For these reasons, stirring in a `crowdtesting` solution into the QA-mix is an extremely powerful tool, as it provides immediate user acceptance testing capabilities.  Moreover, `crowdtesting` ensures that UAT can be performed throughout the entirety of the software development life cycle.

By assigning a veritable army of professional testers to your project via `crowdtesting`, all manner of tests can be performed, covering the entire spectrum of test cases your software requires, including those pertinent to user acceptance testing.  Best of all, `crowdtesting` ensures that your project can _"turn on"_ UAT exactly when and where it's necessary, rather than waiting until late into the development life cycle, when a traditional beta phase might begin.

## Getting the Most Out of UAT Feedback

Another major benefit that `crowdtesting` brings to the user acceptance testing process, is the ability to perform not only "traditional" software testing -- like functional, regression, and integration testing -- but also to capability to assign to `crowdtesters` more robust tasks and test cases, that suit the specific needs of your team and your project.

For example, testers might be assigned an end-to-end test case to cover everything from registering and logging in as a new user to adding items to the cart and making a purchase.  While the success-rate of this task alone is useful data, the sheer quantity of testers involved in `crowdtesting` means that you can gather far more information than the basic test case would ask of them: 

- Did the test perform as expected?
- On a sliding scale, how difficult was the process?
- Were any elements in the application confusing or requiring more clarification?
- Which step(s) gave you the most/least trouble?

The possible lines of inquiry are limitless.  What's critical is that `crowdtesting` provides a huge surge of unique individuals who can test and examine your application in virtually any manner you require, ensuring that user acceptance testing is brought to the forefront of the development process from the very outset.

## Crowdtesting, a Reliable UAT Methodology

There are numerous usability and acceptance testing methodologies which are commonly used in modern software development.  At one end of the spectrum sits a method like `hallway testing`, which selects a random assortment of people to test your software.  As the name suggests, these random people could be pulled from the hallway outside your office door.  Typically, `hallway testing` is best for situations where test cases are broad, and the system simply needs to be checked for any major flaws that prevent basic, fundamental functionality from operating properly.

On the other end of the spectrum of testing methodologies sits `usability audits`, which typically requires an intensive evaluation of the software interface and usability.  Ideally, this is performed by experts in their field (QA team members, professional testers, etc), in stark contrast to the laissez-faire selection methods of `hallway testing`.

Nestled nicely in between these two divergent methods of usability testing sits `crowdtesting`, which combines many of the benefits of both `hallway testing` and `usability audits`.

Due to the volume of individual testers that can be assigned to your project, `crowdtesting` provides a much larger user base for testing purposes than the `hallway testing` method (and likely more people than `usability audits`, as well).  Moreover, since testers in a `crowdtest` environment are all typically from locales all around the globe, `crowdtesting` presents a far more diverse user base than traditional usability testing methods.

While `crowdtesting` doesn't purport to be as intensive a study as a full-blown `usability audit` -- which typically includes a deep analysis of both the software and the testers -- `crowdtesting` does provide many of the benefits of `usability audits`, often with significantly reduced cost and certainly reduced manpower from your organization.  As professional testers, `crowdtesters` can be asked to evaluate most any aspect of the software, from common fault identification and reporting to elaborate usability test cases, as we saw in previous section.
